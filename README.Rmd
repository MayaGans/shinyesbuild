# Step 1: Initialize Golem App

I generally do this by creating a new project and selecting Golem app

# Step 2: Set Title to div to be populated by JS

app_ui <- function(request) {
  tagList(
    # Leave this function for adding external resources
    golem_add_external_resources(),
    # Your application UI logic 
    fluidPage(
      h1(id="title")
    )
  )
}

# Step 3: Initalize NPM library 

```{js}
npm init -y
```

This will create a package.json. You can kind of think of this as the JS version of a `DESCRIPTION` file

# Step 4 Add ESBuild

Add our bundler using: 

```{js}
npm install esbuild
```

This will add `esbuild` as a dependency to our package, as well as a folder called `node_modules` that contains all the libraries we'll be adding. Think of this folder like a local `renv`. ADD THIS FOLDER TO YOUR GIT IGNORE OR PEOPLE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU!!
